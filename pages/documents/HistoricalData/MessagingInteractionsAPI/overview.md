### Introduction

{: .notice}
Our Data APIs enable you to retrieve many attributes and information types. [Please see this table](https://developers.liveperson.com/common-resources-api-data-metrics.html) for the different types of information and attributes which are retrievable via both our Historical and Real Time Data APIs.

The LiveEngage Messaging Interactions API retrieves the most up to date information available about contact center messaging interactions. This API makes it possible to search, filter and analyze data and transcripts of open and closed conversations.

The API returns the conversationâ€™s transcripts and all of its related metadata such as start time, end time, MCS, CSAT, summary, participated agents, the reason the conversation was closed etc.

This API supports the HTTP POST functionality (data retrieval), and all data is returned in JSON format.

<div class="important">Please note that when data is unavailable for a certain field, that field will <b>not be returned</b> as part of the JSON.</div>

### Getting Started

A few things you'll need to get started with this API:

1. **Retrieve your domain**. Use the [LivePerson Domain API](agent-domain-domain-api.html) to retrieve this information by providing the following service name:

	* msgHist

2. This API requires authorization using API key or via login.

	* [Follow these instructions](guides-gettingstarted.html), to create and use an API key. Temporarily, please utilize the same key as the Engagement History API.

3. [Here are the API terms of use](https://www.liveperson.com/policies/apitou).



### Use Cases

* Extract all chat transcripts and accompanying data in order to integrate with any 3rd party application or database

* Extract types of conversations (e.g. low CSAT score, high MCS) and take an action on them.
