The SDEs are session based, hence, there is no need to report the SDEs on each page anew but only once per session. It is highly recommended to report the SDEs at the beginning of the session (as soon as the info exists, report on it).
In case there is any additional information about the user during the session, you may send the same SDEs again in order to enrich the existing data with the new information.

**Sending an SDE multiple times during a session**

Consider the following implementation on a customer page:

| Page | property1 Value | property2 Value | property3 Value |
|----|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Page A | a1 | a2 | [Not supplied] |
| Page B | b1 | [Not supplied] | b3 |

A visitor has been to page A, then moved to page B.  How will the Engagement attributes be updated? The behavior depends on the Engagement Attribute (EA) type.

| Behavior | Behavior description | Engagement attributes | Example Output |
|----|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| *Update Properties* | Updates existing info, maintaining previous values of attributes that were not supplied in latest update | Personal Info (personal) <br> Customer Info (ctmrinfo) <br> Marketing Info (mrktInfo)  | Customer Info: <br> property1: b1 <br> property2: a2 <br> property3: b3
| *Append New Item* | Appends new item each time EA is sent | Viewed Product (prodView) <br> Visitor Error (error) <br> Transaction (purchase) <br> Lead <br> Searched Content | Product 1: <br> property1: a1 <br> property2: a2 <br> Product 2: <br> property1: b1 <br> property3: b3 |
| *Replace Item* | Updates existing info, does not maintain previous values of attributes that were not supplied in latest update | Cart update <br> Service Activity (service) | Cart: <br> property1: b1 <br> property3: b3 |
