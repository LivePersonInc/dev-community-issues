### iOS Messaging SDK - Version 5.1.1
**Release Date**: January 22, 2020 

### Environmental Requirements
The iOS Mobile Messaging SDK version 5.1.1 is compatible with Xcode 11.3.1, Swift version 5.1.3 (swiftlang-1100.0.282.1 clang-1100.0.33.15), and supported on iOS versions 11 through 13.   

### Bugs fixed 
* Fixed issue were CSAT was appearing for auto closed conversations
* Fixed issue where Separator line was being shown while configurations.enableConversationSeparatorLine was disabled

### New Features 
* If the user has denied access before for Audio, Photos, or Camera, the SDK now shows an alert upon usage informing the user that access can be enabled in the settings app.

The message, title, and options buttons for this alert can be customized by updating the values of the LPLocalizable.strings for the keys matching below.

`permissionPopUpDeniedOptionNotNow`
`permissionPopUpDeniedOptionGoToSettings`
`permissionPopUpDeniedTitle`

`permissionPopUpDeniedMicrophoneDescription`
`permissionPopUpDeniedCameraDescription`
`permissionPopUpDeniedPhotoLibraryDescription`

`permissionPopUpRestrictedTitle`
`permissionPopUpRestrictedDescription`
