Push proxy is a feature that can be self managed in the Conversational Cloud console.

In order to enable the push proxy feature, you will require the following data and files:

* **App Name** - The app ID used on registration for push from the mobile app. For example: `com.mybrand.app`

     * Android Registration for Push Method - See SDK’s  [registerLPPusher](android-registerlppusher.html) method.

     * IOS Registration for Push - The app name is usually the Bundle ID or an alternate ID. See SDK’s [registerPushNotifications](consumer-experience-ios-sdk-methods.html#registerpushnotifications) method on how to register. **Note** that in debug mode, the SDK appends a "-Dev" string to the bundle ID on registration to push. You can either configure a different endpoint for this mode or create a “duplicate” configuration to match the new ID (i.e `com.mybrand.app-Dev`).

* **End Point URL** - an end URL to be used for the relevant app’s push.

* **Optional configuration**

	* **Authorization** - HTTP Basic Authentication (BA) header.

		* Username. _Example_:  Alibaba.

		* Password. _Example_: opensesame.

	* **Key** - TLS Key file. _Example_: mybrandpushKey.pem

  * **Certificate** - TLS certification file. _Example_: mybrandpushCrt.pem

This information can be added to the Mobile app management section under Data Sources
