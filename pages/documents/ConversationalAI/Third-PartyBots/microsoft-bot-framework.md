### Overview

The following documentation outlines the configuration for the connector and how to implement functions specifically for **Microsoft Bot Framework**.

{: .important}
We support the Direct Line API version 3.0.

### Bot Configuration

{: .important}
See the [Getting Started guide](bot-connectors-getting-started.html) first to complete pre-requisite steps.

You will be presented with the following screen to complete the Vendor Settings if you've selected **Microsoft Bot Framework**.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:600px" src="img/msbotframework/vendor.png">

Figure 2.1 Showing the configuration that needs to be filled out

The following Microsoft information should be provided to LivePerson:

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Item</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Direct Line Secret</td>
    <td>The first key provided in the direct line channel configuration </td>
    <td>x3XkXXoadX0.xknotlXk8VbU6vXXXX4kwdsGW-N3m-4XjTHPTde4XXX</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Direct Line Endpoint</td>
    <td>The endpoint the connector should use to reach the bot. Apart from the default you can also choose an endpoint that is close to the region that your account is configured for</td>
    <td>https://directline.botframework.com/v3/directline</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Multiple Activities (Optional)</td>
    <td>The connector by default only waits on the first response activities send by the bot and pass it to the customer. If you intent to send multiple activities with the same `ReplyToId` you should activate this feature.
     The value describes the time the connector will wait [in milliseconds] and then check again for further responses. The connector will continue checking in this interval as long as he finds more responses. If no additional responses can be found after this interval all responses until this point will be returned </td>
    <td>1000</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The Direct Line Secret can be found in the Azure Portal if you select the corresponding Web App Bot and edit the Configuration of the Direct Line Channel.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:750px" src="img/msbotframework/secret.png">
Figure 2.2 The Direct Line Secret

For validation of the credentials provided, you can perform a connection test to see if the messages can be sent to the channel with the provided secret by clicking on the button "Test Connection".
For this test it is not necessary for the bot to respond with a message.

### Limitations

Currently advanced features of the direct line protocol like actions and attachments are not supported.
The Bot Connector utilizes the **channelData** property for anything besides plain text.

It is expected that a bot responds to every message sent by the consumer.
If no response is detected in a certain time frame, the Bot Connector assumes something is wrong and tries to transfer the conversation to an agent.

If you want the bot to reply with more than one message, you should use the [multiMessage](#sending-multiple-responses) feature or configure the `Multiple Activities` option.

### Rich Content (Structured Content)

Structured content/Rich Content is supported by the core LivePerson platform. Documentation for the feature can be found [here](getting-started-with-rich-messaging-introduction.html).

To send Rich Content from a bot implemented with the Microsoft Bot Framework, send it in the `channelData` of the message activity.

This should contain a valid structured content body, along with an optional property containing metadata required for the structured content. Always validate your structured content using [this tool](https://livepersoninc.github.io/json-pollock/editor/) before using it in a bot.

{: .important}
If Images are sent in Rich content, then their URLs must be added to a whitelist via internal LivePerson configuration (Houston: `messaging.rich.content.valid.urls`). Please note that you must add all possible domains to this list manually as wildcards are not supported. Moreover, All domains must be HTTPS secure.

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "text": "",
  "channelData": {
    "metadata": [
      {
        "type": "ExternalId",
        "id": "ABCD1234"
      }
    ],
    "structuredContent": {
      "type": "vertical",
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "button",
          "click": {
            "actions": [
              {
                "text": "Recommend me a movie",
                "type": "publishText"
              }
            ]
          },
          "title": "Recommend a movie"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Sending Quick Replies

{: .important}
**Please note** Quick Replies are only supported in Messaging Conversations.

Quick Replies is a special type of Structured Content. Is is a message sent along with predefined answers. The documentation can be found [here](quick-replies-introduction-to-quick-replies.html).
The message property in the Structured Content is mandatory.
For detailed information on Quick Replies check out the documentation for the specific channel ([Mobile SDK and Web](mobile-sdk-and-web-templates-quick-replies-template.html), [Facebook Messenger](facebook-messenger-templates-quick-replies-template.html), [Google RCS Business Messaging](google-rcs-business-messaging-templates-quick-replies-template.html))

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "text": "",
  "channelData": {
    "metadata": [
      {
        "type": "ExternalId",

                }
              ],
              "metadata": [
                {
                  "type": "ExternalId",
                  "id": "No-4321"
                }
              ]

          }
        ]
      },
      "message": "Do you like Bots?"
    }
  }
}
```

### Welcome Event

The behavior of the welcome event is different depending on whether the bot is for chat or messaging. This divergence comes down to the way that each individual LivePerson product works..

A Messaging conversation qualifies as "initiated" from a Conversational Cloud perspective only after the consumer sends their first message. The consumer is prompted for their initial message in the channel they have chosen to initiate the conversation. As a result, the consumer’s first message is something that can be parsed by the bot and an intent determined.

A Chat conversation is considered started when the chat is routed to an agent. Best practice is for the agent to provide the first response. In this scenario, there is no text from the consumer to parse, thus the default ‘WELCOME’ event is utilized as a start point for the bot to prompt the user to provide input and progress the conversation.

Ensure you have an ‘entry point’ in your bot that responds to the default ‘WELCOME’ action send by a new chat customer.

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "text": "",
  "channelData": {
    "action": {
      "name": "WELCOME"
    }
  }
}
```

Figure 5.1 Welcome activity on chat

### Transfer / Escalations

Transfers and escalations are straightforward in both chat and messaging.

At the beginning of a chat session or when a messaging bot logs in, the whole list of enabled skills on the account is retrieved, keyed by name and stored.

When a transfer is requested by the bot, the provided skill name is matched to the skill existing on the account and the conversation is escalated based on this skill.

<div class="notice">
<strong>Naming Conventions:</strong> 
When naming skills the bot can escalate to, you should use the Kebab Case <italic>(e.g. human-expert)</italic> for the skill matching to work.
</div>

For **Microsoft Bot Framework**, the bot should provide the specific name in the payload of the activity.
You can use the official Microsoft BotBuilder SDK method called [EventFactory.createHandoffInitiation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/botbuilder/eventfactory?view=botbuilder-ts-latest).

An additional text message can also be provided.

```javascript
{
  import { EventFactory, TurnContext } from "botbuilder";

  // context should be of type TurnContext
  const handoffContext = { skill: "CUSTOM" };

  const payload = {
    text: "",
    ...EventFactory.createHandoffInitiation(context, handoffContext),
  };
}
```

Figure 6.1 Bot activity for a transfer request

Also, you can provide the specific action in the **channelData** of the message activity.
The action must be named **"TRANSFER"** and the skill must be provided in the parameters object as shown in Figure 6.2

An additional text message can also be provided.

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "text": "",
  "channelData": {
    "action": {
      "name": "TRANSFER",
      "parameters": {
        "skill": "CUSTOM"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Figure 6.2 Alternative bot activity for a transfer request

### Close Conversation

To close a chat or messaging conversation, we provide an action object similar to a transfer.

For that, we can use the official Microsoft BotBuilder Activity Type **[End of Conversation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-activities?view=azure-bot-service-3.0#endofconversation)**.

An additional text message can also be provided.

```json
{
  "type": "endOfConversation",
  "text": ""
}
```

Figure 7.1 Bot Activity for a close conversation request

Also, you can provide the specific action in the **channelData** of the message activity.
The action must be named **"CLOSE_CONVERSATION"**.

An additional text message can also be provided.

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "text": "",
  "channelData": {
    "action": {
      "name": "CLOSE_CONVERSATION"
    }
  }
}
```

Figure 7.2 Alternative bot Activity for a close conversation request

### Advanced Features

#### Change Time To Response of Conversation

By providing a specific **action** in the **channelData**, the bot can change the TTR of a conversation.

LivePerson Messaging uses 4 different types of priorities:

- "URGENT"
- “NORMAL”
- “PRIORITIZED”
- “CUSTOM”

Only “CUSTOM” can set a value. The unit of the value is in seconds. The values of the other types are defined in the Agent Workspace.

A text message can also be provided simultaneously in the activity json.

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "text": "",
  "channelData": {
    "action": {
      "name": "CHANGE_TTR",
      "parameters": {
        "ttrType": "CUSTOM",
        "value": "300"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Figure 8.1 Activity with TTR Change

#### Sending Pause/Delay Messages

It is possible to send an event of type "delay" before regular content events and actions. This specifies the time the bot will wait before displaying the next message. There are two properties, `delay` and `typing`.

```javascript
{
  "type": "message",
  "text": "",
  "channelData": {
    "delay": {
      "delay": 1,
      "typing": true
    }
  }
}
```

Figure 8.2 Activity resulting in a delay with typing indicator

- **delay:** This is the number of seconds the bot will wait. These are expected to be only whole numbers for example for one second delay you will write 1 as a value</li>
- **typing:** This property will enable/disable the typing indicator while delay is happening. It is optional; if not provided then the value will be considered as true.</li>

**Note:**
This **single** delay activity will only work as expected if you've enabled the "Multiple Activities" feature in the bot configuration.
Using the delay as a sole response activity without this feature is effectively a ‘no response’ action and might only be useful if the bot should not respond at all without an error escalation.

#### Sending Private Text Messages

It is possible to send a private text message from the Conversational Cloud via the agent workspace. This feature can now be used via the Third-Party bots as well. This will allow Brands to define private message text within the conversational flow of the bot. These messages are published into the conversation for other Agent/Manger participants. This enables Brands to customize messages giving more insight, summarizing actions taken by the bot, or also advising on next actions the handover agent should take.

{: .important}
Please note If you have not migrated to new Agent Workspace you will not be able to see the `Private` message indicator in the conversation window. Nevertheless, private text messages will not be shown to the consumer and only remain visible to Agents and Managers.

Please note private text message will never be shown to the consumer and will be visible only inside the conversation window of agent workspace. There are two properties, `text` and `messageAudience` which need to be added in with the response body of the function.

| key             | value                                 | notes                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| text            | any string value                      | mandatory                 |
| messageAudience | value should be "AGENTS_AND_MANAGERS" | case sensitive, mandatory |

<br />

A single private text message with an action can be send by adding `text` and `messageAudience` properties with relevant action (e.g. [Transfer/Escalations](#transfer--escalations)) properties. An example of such case is below:

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "text": "This is a private text",
  "channelData": {
    "messageAudience": "AGENTS_AND_MANAGERS",
    "action": {
      "name": "TRANSFER",
      "type": "client",
      "parameters": {
        "skill": "human_skill"
      },
      "result_variable": "none"
    }
  }
}
```

Figure 8.3 Transfer activity with a private message visible to agents and managers

#### Engagement attributes as context

Third-Party bots allows the collection of engagement attributes (more information can be found [here](engagement-attributes-types-of-engagement-attributes.html)) if `Engagement Attributes` option is checked in the `Conversation Type` step as shown in Figure 8.3.

<img class="fancyimage" style="width:750px" src="img/engagement_attr_select.png">
Figure 8.4 Conversation Type step in creation/modification of bot configuration.

These attributes are **only** collected at the start of a conversation. Third-Party bots leverage the LivePerson Visit Information API to collect the engagement attributes, Further information Visit Information API can be found [here](visit-information-api-visit-information.html). Moreover, Engagement attributes are not updated throughout the life cycle of a conversation and only passed along with each message request. In Microsoft Bot these engagement attributes are added to the property `lpSdes` which is part of another custom property of `context`. This context information within a conversation is preserved/passed in `channelData` property (further information about `channelData` can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-connector-api-reference?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#activity-object)). An example of the request body can be seen below:

```javascript
{
  "text": "Some Conversation Text",
  "channelData": {
    "context": {
      "lpEvent": {}, // Holds LP Events
      "lpSdes": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### Sending Multiple Responses

As stated under Limitations the default behaviour of our connector is to process the first responses we find on the channel. In case `Multiple Activities`
is not enabled or the waiting period is set to low, the connector might not retrieve every activity your bot is sending.

In that case we also provide a way to define multiple bot responses in a single Direct Line activity. As with all channel specific content this is defined in the channelData property.
The array in the multiMessage property can contain the objects identified by the following types:

- **text:** A plain message
- **delay:** A delay between messages. **Important**: This format is different from the one described further above for a single message. You can only define the delay. There is no flag for the typing indicator.</li>
- **private-message:** A private message as described in [Sending Private Text Messages](#sending-private-text-messages)
- **structured-content:** A structured content as described in [Rich Content (Structured Content)](#rich-content--structured--content)

```javascript
{
  "type": "message",
  "text": "",
  "channelData": {
    "multiMessage": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "value": "this is a text"
      },
      {
        "type": "private-message",
         "value": {
              "text": "This is a private text",
              "messageAudience": "AGENTS_AND_MANAGERS",
          }
      },
      {
        "type": "delay",
        "value": 1 // value is considered as seconds
      },
      {
        "type": "structured-content",
        "value": {
          "metadata": [],
          "structuredContent": {}
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Figure 8.5 Activity excerpt with a multiMessage array containing messages of different types

#### Sending Encoded Metadata

Conversational Cloud Messaging platform provides a new metadata input type (“encodedMetadata”) for passing a base64 encoded metadata on a conversation. The new metadata input type is in addition to the existing [conversation metadata](messaging-agent-sdk-conversation-metadata-guide.html) input field.
Third-party Bot also supports this property and this section will cover the information needed for you to send encoded metadata within your conversations. Before sending encoded metadata you must ensure the following conditions in order to successfully send the data.

<ul>
  <li><b>Common.EncodedMetadata</b> AC feature is ON</li>
  <li>Content is base64 encoded</li>
  <li> Metadata size is limited to 5k</li>
</ul>

{: .important}
Failing to comply with the above validation points will cause the message to be dropped. This feature is only available for the messaging conversations not for chat conversations

Encoded Metadata can be sent with simple Text, Rich Content (structured content) and Multiple responses.

##### Sending a Text Message with Encoded Metadata

For sending `encodedMetadata` with a text message you need to provide this property in `channelData` object. Be careful with the camel-case characters you must provide it exactly the same. An example of the simple text message response is below:

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "text": "Hi i am sending a text with encoded metadata!!",
  "channelData": {
    "encodedMetadata": "ewoic29tZUluZm8iOiAiSSB3YXMgZW5jb2RlZCIKfQ=="
  }
}
```

Figure 8.6 Activity excerpt containing encodedMetadata for plain text

##### Sending Rich Content (structured content) with Encoded Metadata

For sending [structured content](getting-started-with-rich-messaging-introduction.html). You need to add additional property of `encodedMetadata` with your rich content object that you have defined within `channelData` property. An example of the simple Rich Content `JSON` can be seen below:

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "text": "Hi i am sending a structured content with encoded metadata!!",
  "channelData": {
    "metadata": [
      {
        "id": "1234",
        "type": "ExternalId"
      }
    ],
    "encodedMetadata": "ewoic29tZUluZm8iOiAiSSB3YXMgZW5jb2RlZCIKfQ==",
    "structuredContent": {
      "type": "vertical",
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "button",
          "click": {
            "actions": [
              {
                "text": "Recommend a movie",
                "type": "publishText"
              }
            ]
          },
          "title": "Recommend a movie"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Figure 8.7 Activity excerpt containing encodedMetadata for Rich Content

##### Sending Multiple Responses with Encoded Metadata

For sending Encoded Metadata with multiple responses one must provide an additional property of `encodedMetadata` with the already existing `type` and `value` properties under `multiMessage` array object. Sending encoded metadata is supported for the `text` and `structure-content` types only. An example of sending encoded metadata with both types can be found below.

{: .important}
**Please note** if you will send `encodedMetadata` within the `value` property of type `structure-content`, then it will not be passed. This kind of format is only acceptable if you are sending a single Rich Content as a response. Furthermore, for each message, you can see different `encodedMetadata` are defined so both of the messages will be sent with different encoded metadata.

```javascript
{
  "type": "message",
  "text": "",
  "channelData": {
    "multiMessage": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "value": "this is a text",
        "encodedMetadata": "ewoic29tZUluZm8iOiAiSSB3YXMgZW5jb2RlZCIKfQ=="
      },
      {
        "type": "structured-content",
        "encodedMetadata": "ZGlmZmVyZW50IGVuY29kZWQgbWV0YWRhdGE=",
        "value": {
          "metadata": [
            // ... Some structured content metadata
          ],
          "structuredContent": {
            // ... Some structured content object
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
