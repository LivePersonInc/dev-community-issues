The Order Status template is designed to show a customer their order status based on either an order number or email address. This template is integrated with Shopify and a fake Shopify store for demonstration purposes. You can enter the order numbers 1162 or 1163 to return order status results from the test Shopify integration.

Your app can access the last 60 days of orders for a store. You can request access to a store’s full order history in your Shopify Store.

### Included items

#### Dialogs

* Welcome

    * The Welcome dialog greets the user and then requests the required information from the user. 

    * The CHECK_ORDER_STATUS API requires either the order number or the email address associated with the order.

    * API Success and Fail messages will be displayed accordingly.

* Fallback

    * When a user enters an input that is not recognized, it will go to the Fallback dialog.

    * If a user hits the Fallback dialog up to a certain threshold, they will be escalated to an Agent.

* Return Policy

    * As an example of how you might want to include your Return Policy or other content, we’ve added an additional dialog.

    * This could also be maintained within a Knowledge Base.

* Agent Escalation

    * If a user reaches their Fallback maximum or if they enter an "agent" keyword or intent, they will be escalated to an Agent.

#### Integrations

* CHECK_ORDER_STATUS

    * This integration connects to a middleware API that returns a Shopify order status.

    * The Shopify store credentials must be configured in the Global Functions. 

* Transfer

    * As you would expect, this will perform a transfer to a Conversational Cloud skill.

    * You will need to configure the skill name, id and transfer message in the Global Functions

### Configuration needed

To customize this template, you will need to do the following.

#### General dialog customization

As noted previously, you will want to review each of the dialogs, starting with Welcome to customize the verbiage used to greet your customer and request their details.

This is done simply by editing the text copy of the interactions and hitting Enter or using the menu to Save.

#### Global Functions customization

Click **Global Functions** to access all the global functions and variables to be configured.
