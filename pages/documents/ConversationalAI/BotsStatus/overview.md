Use the Bots Status application to check the status of all your bots from a single location. 

You can use the application to monitor and manage both custom bots and post-conversation survey bots.

### Bot agent connector statuses

An agent connector can have one of the following statuses:

* **Ready to Start**: The connector was added successfully, but it hasn't been started for the first time.
* **Not Connected**: The connection to Conversational Cloud has been dropped, or the connector has just started and hasn't yet had the chance to update its status after connection. 
* **Online**: The connector is running, and all end-to-end connections are working well.
* **Offline**: At least one underlying component isn't working, causing end-to-end connections not to function. The connector is in an error state and isn't running.
* **Stopped**: The connector isn't running because it was manually stopped.
