In order to retrieve the Agent's public profile during a conversation (which is useful if you're looking to display specific agent details, like agent name or picture, during the conversation), we'll need to make a call to the [Users API](https://developers.liveperson.com/users-api-methods-get-user-by-id.html).

```sh
curl https://$domain/api/account/$accountId/configuration/le-users/users/$userId
```

Please see [the Users API](users-api-appendix.html) for more information on the response this call will receive.
