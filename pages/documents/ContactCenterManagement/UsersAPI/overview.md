### Introduction

Users within Conversational Cloud can be agents, agent managers, administrators or campaign managers.  For brands with large number of agents, the user list may need to be updated on a regular basis.  The user entity includes name, picture URL, password, skill and other important user information.

**Note: the current version of the API is 4.0. In order to avoid errors, please add a query parameter to your calls specifying the version, like so:**

`https://API_REQUEST?v=4.0`

### Getting Started

A few things you'll need to get started with this API:

1. **Retrieve your domain**. Use the [LivePerson Domain API](agent-domain-domain-api.html) to retrieve this information by providing the following service name:

	* Read only: accountConfigReadOnly

	* Read/Write: accountConfigReadWrite

2. This API requires authorization using _either_ a login or an API key methodology.

	* **Log a user into Conversational Cloud** using the [Login Service API](login-getting-started.html). Provide a username and password, and receive an authorization token (bearer). Use this token as your authorization header in all API requests.

	* [Follow these instructions](guides-gettingstarted.html), to create and use an API key.

3. [Here are the API terms of use](https://www.liveperson.com/policies/apitou).

4. When using this API, it is recommended that you implement our [Retry Policy and KeepAlive best practices](guides-retry-policy.html)
